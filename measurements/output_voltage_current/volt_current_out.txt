% output voltage and current measured with Rauenb√ºhler Alpha Centauri
% output voltage = 208 Vrms = 294 Vpk measured at anode of ONE tube. The other tube contributes the same voltage swing, but with opposite polarity
% output current measured from voltage dop aross a 1000 Ohm resistor inserted between the amp output and the headphone connector.
