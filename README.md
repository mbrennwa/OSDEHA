# Open Source DHT Electrostatic Headphone Amp (OSDEHA)

This repository contains the documentation for the OSDEHA amplifier, which is developed and discussed at diyAudio (1).

This repository is currently used as a collection of ideas and stuff. If these ideas converge into something useful at some point, the repository is intended to contain the complete documentation allowing DIY enthusiasts to build their own OSDEHA.
