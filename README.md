# Open-Source Directly-Heated Triode Electrostatic Headphone Amplifier (OSDEHA)

The OSDEHA is an open-hardware electrostatic headphone amplifier based on directly heated triodes (DHTs).  
It is designed for DIY builders who value simplicity, transparency, and full access to the underlying circuit and mechanical design.

The project is developed openly, with design discussion and iteration happening in the DIY audio community. All design files required to manufacture and assemble the amplifier are provided.

⚠️ **Warning:** This project involves lethal voltages. Do not attempt to build or operate this amplifier unless you understand and respect high-voltage safety practices.
