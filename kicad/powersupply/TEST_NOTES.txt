- Built and tested heater supply for input stage tubes + relay for HV delay. Needed to reverse one of the rectifier diodes. Seems to work ok, but still need to test htr supply with proper load.
- Built negative bias + buffer HV supply. Needed to attach part of the GND plane to GND (was not connected on PCB).

- Tested neg. bias + buffer HV supply. Needed to adjust some of the resistor values in the CCS for voltage reference. Works ok, also under load of up to 120 mA.
- Built B+ and B- supplies. Did not yet test them.

- Tested delay switch for B+ and B- supply. Works.
- Tested B+ and B- supply (without load). Works. Adjusted to +/-440 VDC out.

- Tested PSU board using the Toroidy mains transformers (instead of DC input from bench PSU as before). Works.
- Built stator HV bias. Tested by loading it with a 4.7 uF capacitor for a few seconds, then meansured the voltage across the cap using a DVM. Voltage drops due to internal resistance of DVM, but first reading was above 500 VDC, so it seems to work ok. (see also further measurement 2024-05-09)

- Moved PSU board to prototype chassis with IEC inlet and mains switch for easier and safer work
- Tested ground loop breaker. Works as expected.

2024-05-09
- Installed mains transformers and wiring in proto chassis
- Tested PSU in proto chassis (ok)
- Measured stator BIAS using a very high value resistor (approx 10 G Ohm) in series with the DVM (internal resistance approx. 10 M Ohm). The 10 GOhm resistor effectively reduces the load on the BIAS supply. Calibrated the DVM readings from other PSU outputs. Result: BIAS = 575 VDC (that's less than 1% off from the target!). Perfect.

TODO
- test time-delay adjust range for B+ / B- relay
