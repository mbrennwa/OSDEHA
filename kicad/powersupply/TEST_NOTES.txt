- Built and tested heater supply for input stage tubes + relay for HV delay. Needed to reverse one of the rectifier diodes. Seems to work ok, but still need to test htr supply with proper load.
- Built negative bias + buffer HV supply. Needed to attach part of the GND plane to GND (was not connected on PCB).

- Tested neg. bias + buffer HV supply. Needed to adjust some of the resistor values in the CCS for voltage reference. Works ok, also under load of up to 120 mA.
- Built B+ and B- supplies. Did not yet test them.

- Tested delay switch for B+ and B- supply. Works.
- Tested B+ and B- supply (without load). Works. Adjusted to +/-440 VDC out.

TODO
- Test ground loop breaker
- test time-delay adjust range for B+ / B- relay
- Build and test stator bias supply
- build full PSU with transformers and IECÂ socket on a board/base for further testing
