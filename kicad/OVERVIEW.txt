OSDEHA PCBs / boards

A complete set of PCBs for a stereo OSDEHA consists of the following:

2 x amplifier boards
1 x power supply board (HV supply, heater supply for input tubes, stator BIAS, HV power-on delay)
4 x Coleman DHT Filament regulators (PCBs + parts kit from Rode Coleman)
2 x Raw DC supply for Coleman DTH Filament regs
1 x volume control board (different versions for different pots: Alps RK27, Khozmo, etc.)

Mains transformers:
1 x mains transformer for HV supply (B+, B-, neg. HV for buffer + grid bias)
1 x mains transformer for filament / heaters supply_
	- 1 winding for heaters of input tubes (regulated DC, common for both channels)
	- 2 windings for raw DC supply to Coleman DHT filament regs (each channel has 1 x raw DC supply for 2 x Coleman regs)	
	
1 x Mains transformer for HV supply
toroidal, “Audio” grade with shields beween windings
Primariy: 2 x 115 VAC
[secondary specs see test notes and Kicad schematic!]
