To-Do list for the kicad projects:


General:
- Try to use same make/type of parts and footprints where suitable to make life easier with ordering parts and fitting them on the PCB.
- Check correct pinout, especially with FETs and stuff. And double check! (Derived footprints may have different pinouts...)
- Check for correct footprints. And double check.
- Check for consistency of board connectors:
	* same type of connectors on both ends
	* consistency of pinout on both PCBs
- Dimensions of boards should fit the chassis, and the different boards should fit next to each other and around the power tubes, mains transformers, volume control, etc.


Connectors, sockets
- Use Molex KK or MiniFit Jr (gold contacts would be nice, check voltage limits and other specs)
- Molex MiniFit Jr:
	https://www.mouser.ch/new/molex/molex-minifit-jr-connectors
	Max voltage: 600 V
	Max current: 13 A
	no gold contacts available (?)
- Molex KK:
	https://www.mouser.ch/new/molex/molex-kk
	Series KK-396 max voltage/current: 600 V / 5 A
	Series KK-254 max voltage: 250 V


Grounding:
- Connect circuit GND to Chassis/PE via ground-loop breaker on the PSU board.
- Connection from PCB to chassis: separate wire, or via metal screw mount connecting to PCB?


FETs:
- Check for need of Zener protection diode(s). Some types have built-in Zeners, others dont.


Amplifier board:
- There will be two boards for Left and Right channels mounted to the heatsinks on the sides of the chassis.
The boards will be rotated by 180 degrees. Connectors should therefore be on the PCB side on the far side from the heatsink, towards the inside of the chassis (not on the front/rear sides).


Coleman DHT regulators:
- Can the Coleman boards sit on the main amp boards piggy-back style?
