- Built amplifier input stage. Picked random 6E5P tubes from the box (no matching etc.)
- Operating points around tubes are as expected (measured: 11 mA Ic, 3.1 V-cathode)
- Measured gain = 30.1 dB = 32x
- Captured harmonic and IM distortion spectra at output voltages of 1.0, 3.16, 10, and 31.6 Vrms. Looks ok.

TO DO
- Build and test buffer stage
- Build and test Coleman DHT filament supplies
- Build and test output stage
