There are several open hardware licenses available, each with its own specific terms and conditions. Here are a few notable ones:

    CERN Open Hardware License (OHL): Developed by CERN, this license is specifically tailored for open hardware projects. It requires that anyone who distributes the hardware design or a derivative work must make the design files available under the same license terms. It comes in two versions: OHL v1.2 and OHL v2.0.

    TAPR Open Hardware License: The TAPR Open Hardware License is designed by the Tucson Amateur Packet Radio Corporation (TAPR) and is intended for open hardware projects in the amateur radio and packet radio community. It is similar in spirit to the CERN OHL but tailored to the needs of the amateur radio community.

    Solderpad Hardware License: This license is designed for open hardware projects and is similar to the CERN OHL. It allows for free use, modification, and distribution of hardware designs, provided that attribution is given to the original creator and that derivative works are licensed under the same terms.

    Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) Certification: While not a license itself, the OSHWA provides a certification program for open hardware projects. Projects that meet the requirements of the OSHWA certification are allowed to use the Open Source Hardware (OSHW) logo, indicating their commitment to openness and transparency.

These licenses vary in their specific terms and conditions, including requirements for attribution, redistribution, and compatibility with other licenses. It's important to carefully review the terms of each license and choose the one that best aligns with your goals for sharing your hardware design while protecting your rights as a creator.

"Open source" and "open hardware" are related concepts but they refer to different types of creations and the principles behind them.

Open Source:

    Open source typically refers to software where the source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute it.
    Open source software is often developed in a collaborative manner, with contributions from a community of developers.
    Open source licenses, such as the GPL or MIT License, govern how the software can be used, modified, and distributed while preserving certain freedoms for users.

Open Hardware:

    Open hardware refers to physical objects, such as electronic circuits, mechanical designs, or other hardware components, where the design files and specifications are made available to the public.
    Open hardware allows anyone to study, modify, manufacture, and distribute the hardware design.
    Open hardware projects often share their designs using licenses specifically tailored for hardware, such as the CERN Open Hardware License (OHL) or the TAPR Open Hardware License.

In summary, while open source primarily applies to software and focuses on the availability of source code, open hardware extends this concept to physical objects, allowing for transparency, collaboration, and freedom to use and modify hardware designs.
