There are several open hardware licenses available, each with its own specific terms and conditions. Here are a few notable ones:

    CERN Open Hardware License (OHL): Developed by CERN, this license is specifically tailored for open hardware projects. It requires that anyone who distributes the hardware design or a derivative work must make the design files available under the same license terms. It comes in two versions: OHL v1.2 and OHL v2.0.

    TAPR Open Hardware License: The TAPR Open Hardware License is designed by the Tucson Amateur Packet Radio Corporation (TAPR) and is intended for open hardware projects in the amateur radio and packet radio community. It is similar in spirit to the CERN OHL but tailored to the needs of the amateur radio community.

    Solderpad Hardware License: This license is designed for open hardware projects and is similar to the CERN OHL. It allows for free use, modification, and distribution of hardware designs, provided that attribution is given to the original creator and that derivative works are licensed under the same terms.

    Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) Certification: While not a license itself, the OSHWA provides a certification program for open hardware projects. Projects that meet the requirements of the OSHWA certification are allowed to use the Open Source Hardware (OSHW) logo, indicating their commitment to openness and transparency.

These licenses vary in their specific terms and conditions, including requirements for attribution, redistribution, and compatibility with other licenses. It's important to carefully review the terms of each license and choose the one that best aligns with your goals for sharing your hardware design while protecting your rights as a creator.
