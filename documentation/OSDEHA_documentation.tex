\section{Overview}

This document describes an audio amplifier for electrostatic headphones. The design of the amplifier is targeted at DIY builders and is published as open hardware (see \secn{license}).

Electrostatic headphones operate on audio signals characterized by high voltage and low current. This is the domain of vacuum tubes, making them most suitable as drivers for e-stats.  While there exist a number of tube amplifiers for e-stat headphones, many of these designs do not utilize directly-heated triodes (DHTs), which exhibit outstanding linearity and sound quality.\par

The OSDEHA uses DHT tubes for its output stage and implements the following design goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item The audio output is taken directly from the anodes of the DHT output tubes. No transformer or capacitors to transfer the power to the headphones.
\item The amplifier input takes balanced input at signal levels of modern audio sources (mostly DACs these days).
\item Focus on quality of audio reproduction and electronic design, not on low cost.
\item The amplifier should be reasonably compact.
\end{itemize}


\section{Amplifier Circuit}

Electrostatic headphones use three electrodes. The two outer electrodes (stators) are fixed, while the one in the center (diaphragm) is free to move. The diaphragm is biased relative to the stators at a high voltage (with the charge on the diaphramg held constant). The audio signal is applied to the stators, whereby the voltages applied to the two stators are of opposite polarity to drive the diaphgragm. The amplifier output therefore must provide symmetric audio outputs at opposite polarity. According to th design goals, the amplifier also needs a differential input and gain stage. \figr{OPS_concept} shows the conceptual layout of the OSDEHA.

\subsection{Output Stage}
FROM DIYAUDIO POST:
    The output stage needs to drive very high impedance estat headphones. To make sure the audio/AC power is used efficiently into the headphones, the anode loads need to present a (much) higher AC impedance to the anodes. So we're looking at constant-current loads (current sources/sinks, CCS). CCS loads also help with optimizing the linearity and voltage gain of the amplifier, and with suppressing ripple and noise from the +HV rails.
    The gyrator CCS type (as discussed by @mogliaa and others) works as a CCS in the audio/AC domain, but provides a fixed voltage at DC. This may be a useful feature to fix the DC voltages at the anodes, and hence to adjust and maintain the amplifier outputs close to 0 V.
