Input sensitivity, gain, and output voltage level?
- Balanced input (from modern DACs): +/- 4 Vrms = +/- 5.7 Vpk = 11.3 Vpp
- Typical sensitivity for estat headphones is 100 dB-SPL / 100 Vrms.
- Aim for 110...120 dB-SPL peak output without clipping
--> Output voltage needed is 10...20 dB higher than 100 Vrms = 3.16...10 x 100 Vrms = 316...1000 Vrms = 447...1414 Vpk
- Gain needs to be 316...1000 Vrms / 4 Vrms = 79...250
- For comparison:
	typical Stax amp: gain=500...1000, max ouput voltage 300...470 Vrms
	Stax T2 amp: gain=1000, max ouput voltage 630 Vrms
	Blue Hawaii: max. output is 1600 Vpp = 800 Vpk = 566 Vrms
	
Ouput current needs, Class-A bias current:
- Basic idea/concept to determine the current draw from estat (but the numbers seem a bit optimistic): https://www.head-case.org/forums/topic/12155-output-stage-current-requirements-for-electrostatic-headphone-amps/
- capacitor (=estat): Q = C x U --> I = dQ/dt = C x dU/dt 
- What is the required dU/dt (slew rate) value?
	- Bob Cordell, Designing Audio Power Ampliers: an amp that produces 40 Vpk output needs slew rate of 12.5 V/µs  to sustain a 50 kHz sine at full power.
	- Nelson Pass 1978 work: "highest slew rate he found with music signals was 1.5 volts/microsecond up to clipping levelsj" (see https://www.head-case.org/forums/topic/12155-output-stage-current-requirements-for-electrostatic-headphone-amps/)
	- Nelson Pass, in a later interview: "...But given that you're on the 5V/µs rate, we ultimately settled on approximately 50V/µs as a speed beyond which was fine, but it became a minimal figure that we deal with in our designs." (this probably referred to a 100W amp driving an 8 Ohm speaker, see https://www.stereophile.com/content/nelson-pass-simple-sounds-better-page-4)
	--> slew-rate numbers required for a 100 W amp driving an 8 Ohm speaker (i.e, 40 Vpk) range from 1.5...50 V/µs.
	--> let's assume 15 V/µs for a 40 Vpk drive
- RMS voltage of a typical estat amp is about 500 Vrms = approx 800 Vpk
--> target slew rate for estat amp: dU/dt = 15 V/µs / 40 Vpk x 800 Vpk = 300 V/µs
--> current needed to charge the estat capacitance the the required slew rate: I = C x dU/dt = 100 pF x 300 V/µs = 30 mA
--> for push-pull amp with 30 mA output: each leg needs to provide 15 mA, so the tubes in each leg must be biased to more than 15 mA for Class-A.


HV bias:
- Stax PRO, Hifiman: 580 VDC
- Stax not-PRO: 2?? VDC
- Warwick Bravura: 1000 VDC



Output stage:
- use similar topology as in Rauenbühler Alpha Centauri amp: two triodes working in opposite polarity, cathodes at negative voltage, anodes biased close to 0 VDC. Output signal is the delta between the two anodes.
- use active loads on the anodes instead of anode load resistors. Simple CCS or (maybe better) an Ale Moglia "Gyrator" / voltage controlled CCS
- Advantage of the Moglia Gyrator CCS: it allows adjusting the DC idle voltage at the anodes. The Moglia Gyrator then fixes the current to the operating point corresponding to the chosen DC bias voltage, and the AC/audio signals are operating at this fixed current with variable audio/AC voltage. The adjustabililty of the DC anode voltage means that both triodes can be adjusted to the same DC anode potential, and hence the DC imbalance between the two triodes can be adjusted and fixed to 0 V.

General construction
- Design PCB(s) that hold(s) the whole amp (except the tubes and transformers). It may make sense to have separate PCBs for LEFT/RIGHT and PSU, but messing with different boards or flying leads for a contraption of many different 3rd party boards/units is ugly.

Triode type for use in output stage
- Needs to swing +/- 400 Vpk or so
- Should be okay with high(er) voltage peaks beyond it's own active drive (reactance of the capacitive headphones!)
- DC current bias 15 mA or more (to provide substantial headroom to drive the headphones)
- Use something that is available (either new production or plenty old stock available)
- 801(A) tubes seem about right (NOS available, Elrog makes 801A tubes)
- Emissionlabs 20B tube maybe?

Input stage
- can be tube or FET or BJT
- Some tubes, indirectly heated: use very linear tube! 6SN7 (gain=20), ECC88 (gain=33), D3A-triode (gain=77)
- Some tubes, directly heated: 3C4/DL96 (gain=8, https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/designing-a-vacuum-tube-front-end-card-for-the-vfet-diy-amp.371158/page-9)
- Shunt-cascode tube/BJT input+driver: high gain, low distortion! See https://www.bartola.co.uk/valves/2013/03/10/the-shunt-cascode-driver/
