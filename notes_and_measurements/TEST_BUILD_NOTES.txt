Build and test log

2024-04-20
- Built and tested heater supply for input stage tubes + relay for HV delay. Needed to reverse one of the rectifier diodes. Seems to work ok, but still need to test htr supply with proper load.
- Built negative bias + buffer HV supply. Needed to attach part of the GND plane to GND (was not connected on PCB).

2024-04-21
- Tested neg. bias + buffer HV supply. Needed to adjust some of the resistor values in the CCS for voltage reference. Works ok, also under load of up to 120 mA.
- Built B+ and B- supplies. Did not yet test them.

2024-05-03
- Tested delay switch for B+ and B- supply. Works.
- Tested B+ and B- supply (without load). Works. Adjusted to +/-440 VDC out.

2024-05-04
- Tested PSU board using the Toroidy mains transformers (instead of DC input from bench PSU as before). Works.
- Built HV BIAS supply. Tested by loading it with a 4.7 uF capacitor for a few seconds, then meansured the voltage across the cap using a DVM. Voltage drops due to internal resistance of DVM, but first reading was above 500 VDC, so it seems to work ok. (see also further measurement 2024-05-09)

2024-05-04
- Moved PSU board to prototype chassis with IEC inlet and mains switch for easier and safer work
- Tested ground loop breaker. Works as expected.

2024-05-09
- Installed mains transformers and wiring in proto chassis
- Tested PSU in proto chassis (ok)
- Measured diaphgragm BIAS using a very high value resistor (approx 10 G Ohm) in series with the DVM (internal resistance approx. 10 M Ohm). The 10 GOhm resistor effectively reduces the load on the BIAS supply. Calibrated the DVM readings from other PSU outputs. Result: BIAS = 575 VDC (that's less than 1% off from the target!). Perfect.

2024-05-11
- Built amplifier input stage. Picked random 6E5P tubes from the box (no matching etc.):
	Operating points around tubes are as expected (measured: 11 mA Ic, 3.1 V-cathode, Va = 152 V and 142 V)
	Measured gain = 30.1 dB = 32x
	Captured harmonic and IM distortion spectra at output voltages of 1.0, 3.16, 10, and 31.6 Vrms. Looks ok.
- Replaced 6E5P tubes with a nicely matched pair to check for improvements in circuit balance and distortion spectra
	Operating points are very symmetric (Va = 153 V and 154 V), distortion spectra are cleaner (sometimes a by a lot)
- Comparison of harmonic distortion with unmatched / matched 6E5P input tubes:
	V-out (Vrms)	matched		2nd (dB)	3rd (dB)
	1.0		no		-92		--
	1.0		yes		--		--
	3.16		no		-85		-91
	3.16		yes		-91		-110
	10		no		-76		-86
	10		yes		-83		-91
	31.6		no		-64		-94
	31.6		yes		-79		-91

	--> 2nd is always considerably lower with matched tubes, 3rd is sometimes lower.
- Probe slip --> short and bang! Let's stop for today...

2024-05-12
- Built and tested 4 x Coleman DHT Filament Regulators.

2024-05-13
- Work on circuit+PCB design for HV PSU protection (following Jan Didden T-Reg description). Increased trimmer R value for HV time-delay switch to allow longer turn-on delay.
- Work on PCB design for raw-DC supply for Coleman DHT Filament regs.
- Found issue with HV PSU after short (test probe slip): protection Zeners on MOSFets (G-S) shorted out. One MOSFet was drawing a lot of grid current, which messed up the CCS voltage reference. Replaced all HV MOSFets and Zeners.

2024-05-14
- Tested HV PSU: output voltages are ok again, adjusted to target values. Measued voltage drop across the MOSFet gate resistors (300 Ohm): one had 0.0 mV, the other two had 2.7 mV --> gate current is < 1E-5 A, or 50x less than CCS current.
- Check parts on amp board (IPS) after short (probe slip and bang) on 2024-05-11. Replaced the DN2540 parts in the CCS (just in case they were damaged). All resistors checked ok. 6E5P heaters are ok, but the anode/cathode/grid system is shot. Replaced the tubes. Amp IPS now works again. Test signals taken after DC-coupling caps (470nF):
	- Output (balanced) sine signal starts clipping at 106 Vrms. Thats 300 Vpp.
	- Triangle and rect signals are clean, no overshoot.
	- Frequency response is flat up to 720 kHz, where sine signal is down by 1/2x (-6 dB).
	
2024-05-15
- More work on PCB layout for HV PSU (avoid vertical small resistors for easier debugging)
- Fixed errors on amp schematic and PCB (wrong CCS connection, wrong pinout on some FETs). Further improvements on PCB layout.
- Tested fixed-bias voltage adjust/range. Works ok.
- Tested buffer stage. Does not work, seems to short out the HV B2- supply somehow. I can't figure it out, possibly due to the messed up pinout and CCS connection (I tried some workarounds on the PCB, but no success). Tested CCS and buffer circuit in a dead-bug build, and that seemed to work as expected.
- Finalized new version of PCBs (amp, HV PSU, DC-raw filament PSU), exported Gerbers, and ordered new PCBs (JLCPCB).

2024-05-16
- Built wire harness with load resistors for HV PSU for easy and simultaneous testing of the PSU under load: 4-pin KK396 on PSU/PCB end, other end of wires to 3 x 27k power resistors linked to GND.
- Tested PSU again using the load harness: B+ and B- were fine, B2- was at -50 VDC instead of -550 VDC. Removed NPN-BJT (BC550) from current limiter, which fixed the issue (B2 = -549 VDC under load). NPN-BJT was confirmed broken with component tester. Looks like I destroyed the BC550 during some mishap, but did not notice it because the B2- PSU showed the correct voltage (when it was not connected to a load!), so I missed this.
- No-functional buffer stage in the amp (see 2024-05-15) was most likely related to the misbehaving B2- supply.

2024-05-25
- Rebuilt amp (IPS and buffer) using new PCBs. Works as expected. Buffer output starts clipping at 144 Vpp, which is way more than needed to drive the the output stage to full output. No ringing or oscillations visible on scope with triangle or square wave signals. Bandwidth is 670 kHz (-3 dB) or 1 MHz (-6 dB).

2024-05-26
- Determined values of R15 (R20) to get Vbias adjustment centered at target value at output of buffer stage --> R15 = 18.7k is a good value (with R12=47k, R14=20k and R11=1M) --> Vbias = -478V at buffer output if R14/pot is at center position.
- Gate current for Q3 (Q4): voltage across R13 (1M) is <0.2 V, so current is less than 0.2 uA.
- Built and tested raw DC supplies for Coleman Regs. Tested (without load), looks ok.

2024-06-01
- Wired DHT output tubes and Coleman Regs to amplifier board. Tested and adjusted filament supply through amplifier board, works ok.
- Built output stage on amplifier board (mu follower etc.). Connected HV PSUs (B+, B-, B2-). Does not work. Smoke from AOT Fets (or something nearby, could not see well).

2024-06-02
- Rebuilt mu follower / CCS with correct pinout on the FETs. No more smoke, but still does not work. Does the tube/anode load down the protection Zeners and then pulls the gate and the 4.5M resistor low? There is quite a bit of DC across the 4.5M resistor. Also, the B+ supply was broken, so that may also have caused problems with the mu follower / CCS.
- Rebuilt PSU using the new PCB. 6.3 V heater supply tested ok. Need to test the remaining parts.
- B2- supply of new PSU-PCB does not work (B+ and B- not yet tested). Testing B2- without Q5 installed. Very low voltage across RSET. Voltage across R18 (1k) is 0.5V, so CCS current is 0.5 mA (about right). Does the overcurrent limiter (Q6) suck up all the current coming out of R18? --> remove Q6 and check again.

2024-06-03
- Pinout of 2N3904 Q6/Q10/Q14 is backwards on amplifier PCB. This would explain why the current is "sucked out" of the CCS, upseting the voltage reference in the HV PSU.
- Fixed pinout on PCB design.

2024-06-07
- Repaired B2- HV PSU and built B+ and B- HV PSU (using correct pinout of 2N3904 BJT). Tested ok.
- Tested amplifier mu follower / CCS --> killed B+ HV supply again (cf. 2024-06-02).
- Repaired B+ HV supply, using STF5NK100Z (TO220FP) instead of NTHL1000N170M1.
- Tested amplifier mu fullower / CCS again (without DHT tube installed) --> one branch works ok (Anode out at 4 VDC, close to GND), the other has B+ / 440 VDC at Anode out.
- Replaced AOT1N60 and IXTP3N100D2 --> both branches now work ok (ca. 4 VDC at Anode out)

2024-06-08
- testing amplifier / mu follower CCS stage: found poor insulation between HV MOSFETs and heatsink, which caused shorts. Also found poor solder joint on gate resistors of AOT160. Fixed.
- Testing amplifier / mu follower CCS using bench PSU for better control of current limits, starting at lower voltages. DC operating points work ok with 20k load resistors inplace of DHT tubes.
- Testing amplifier / mu follower CCS using OSDEHA HV PSU, with 20k load resistors in place of DHT tubes. DC operating points work ok.
- Testing complete amplifier (input, driver, output mu follower CCS + DHTs) --> DC operating points in output stage ok. Can adjust DC bias to target 20 mA idle current, but DC bias is not perfectly stable but has regular pulses (approx 1 pulse per second). The fluctuations stop if the DHT tubes are disconnected.

2024-06-10
- Pulsating voltage in mu follower CCS stage (and elsewhere) only happens with DHT tubes installed. If dummy resistors are used instead, pulsation is gone.
- Pulses are from RFI/EMI noise pickup. Not specific to OSDEHA! Scope also shows similar pulse signals if probing the solder tin spool.

2024-06-11
- Design note, HV PSU (B+, B-, B2-): replace BJT current limiter with a 10M90S current limiter for use during testing. Once testing is completed, the 10M90S can be replaced by a jumper to avoid any effects of the current limiter on the HV (output impedance, etc.)
- Design note, Mu stage / DHT load: optimize the Mu resistor to prevent it from burning out: can use a slightly lower R value for less dissipation? Use a part with higher dissipation spec? --> use CPF3470R00
- Design note, Mu stage / DHT: insert a proper gate stopper resistor to the CCS FET (like 100-300 Ohm) --> not needed, as gate is already stoppered by the resistor(s) to GND.
- Adjusted output stage to 20 mA idle at each DHT
- Testing amp:
	output clipping visible on scope at 1550 Vpp (using 1:100 resistor voltage divider 100k + 2k + 100k at output and differential scope probe)
	voltage gain output/input = 241x
	frequency response into 200k resistive load (-3 dB) = 10 Hz ... 500 kHz
- Testing amp at high power output, the mu follower CCS cascode FETs Q6/Q8 tend to die. Too much heat? Or too much voltage? Or oscillation?
	- Added thermal paste to one cascode FET (but not the other) --> the one with paste dies again, while the other survives. Not a heat problem.
	- Reduced B+, B-1 and B2- voltages to +400...-500V, so there can't be more than 900V across the cascode FETs, which are specified to 1000V --> they still die. --> Not too much voltage.
	- Cascode FETs don't die while idling, they mostly die when the amp is driven hard with high frequency test signals. Oscillation? Try with larger gate resistors (both at cascode and main CCS FETs).
	(See also https://www.bartola.co.uk/valves/2019/02/03/hybrid-mu-follower-aka-gyrator-rev08-pcb-update --> use of dedicated gate stopper 330R for CCS FET is needed to prevent oscillation!)
	
2024-06-13
- Inserted 330R gate stoppers to CCS FETs, testing the output stage again:
	- DC operation is fine, same as before
	- AC operation with tubes shows less runaway, FETs do not blow up.
	- Driving the output stage hard with high-frequency test signal causes a "flame" in one of the DHT tube. Immediately turned the amp off. Testing output stage with DC bench supplies and dummy load resistors, and it seems fine.
	- One of the CCS loads on the buffer stage burned out. Oscillation? Rebuild CCS, but with larger gate stopper?

2024-06-14
- Repaired buffer stage / CCS. Confirmed working ok using bench PSUs.
- Changed gate stoppers at DN2540 and IXTP parts from 300R to 1k
- Found 100R gate stoppers at DHT tube sockets were toasted. Replaced with 220R.
- Added grid voltage clamp diodes to DHT tube sockets.
- Testing amp with new gate stoppers and diode clamps at DHT grids, but without tubes. Works ok, clamp works.
- Testing amp with one DTH and one dummy load resistor. Tube shows osciallation at 2 MHz, but no runaway. Dummy resistor is clean.

2024-06-16
- Checking for source and cure for oscillation.
- Removing diode clamps at tube sockets does not change oscillation.
- Adding RC snubber (R=10k, C=100p Mica) from anode to cathode/filament on tube socket has only very little effect to reduce the oscillation.
- Oscillation looks like a smoothe sine wave at the tube pins, but less smooth saw-tooth at the PCB pins. This means the HF stuff happens on the PCB side, not at the tube side of the connection leads between PCB and tube.
- Reducing mu resistor in mu stage from 450R to 300R changes oscillation from continuous to intermittent. Reducing it further to 150R, and oscillation is gone. Looks like there was too much feedback in the mu-stage CCS.
- Can the clamp diodes, RC snubber and gate stopper resistor at the tube socket be reduced again? (or entirely removed?)
	- re-installed clamp diodes --> no oscillation
	- remove RC snubber --> no oscillation
	- remove grid stopper --> no oscillation
- Further testing to check how output stage behaves if driven hard --> input/buffer stage blows up. Buffer CCS FETs broken. Repaired. Input stage does not work, no current through tubes. Checked resistors and replaced FETs in tail CCS, still does not work. Tubes ok?

2024-06-22
- Repaired input + driver stage
- Installed DN2540 instead of AOT1N60 as CCS "lower" FET in mu-stage. DC operating point comes out as expected.

2024-06-23
Checking input + driver stage after repair.
- Tried backwards diode from Drain-to-Source on CCS FETs to protect from negative voltage spikes. No effect. The CCS behaves ok even if the CCS FET Drain is driven negative. The FET just shorts the negative spike to B2-, so the diode is useless (confirmed with scope). Removed the diode from the schematic and PCB.
- Found buffer CCS to run at 40 mA bias instead of 10 mA. This may explain the death of the buffer CCS FETs (overheating if driven hard). Increased R-sense values to give 10 mA on board. Changed CCS sense resistors from 150R to 536R in schematic.
- With bench supplies (B+ = 200 V, B- = -60 V, B2- = -160 V): Driver/buffer does not blow up when driven hard into no load, dummy load (resistor + cap), 

2024-07-05
- Testing amp with bench PSUs and a single KT66 dummy (other branch has dummy resistors):
	- Works fine in general
	- There's some noise on the scope traces. Where's that from? Ground loop somehow?
	- Driver/buffer does not blow up when driven hard (300 kHz signals deep into clipping)
	- Increased Rmu to 470 Ohm again, seems to work fine with DN2540 (instead of AOT1N60)
	
2024-10-19
- PSU: tested TO220 BJTs for overload protection. Progress, protection now work ok. Except: Series FETs still die before BJT protection kicks in if there's an instantaneous short.
- Removed tweaks needed for previous tests with KT66 tubes. Brought amplifier up, step by step (front end only, then with VT25 test tubes). Works!
- Warming up with no signal, monitoring DC bias current via voltage across mu resistors. Adjusted a few times to 20 mA (9.4 V across 470R mu resistors) until it was stable after a couple of minutes.
- Testing AC output (using diff probe across balanced output):
	frequency response with MU/CCS switch = mu-stage mode (no load except diff probe):
	lower end: 7 Hz -3 dB-rel, 5 Hz -6 dB-rel.
	upper end: 180 kHz -3 dB-rel,  340 kHz / -6 dB-rel.
- Driving amplifier hard with triangle signal to clipping at approx. 1.6 kVpp. Does not blow up or do other funny things.

	
2024-10-20
- Testing AC output frequency response with 100 pF dummy load (using diff probe across balanced output):

	MU/CCS switch = mu-stage mode:
	lower end: 8.8 Hz -3 dB-rel, 5.5 Hz -6 dB-rel.
	upper end: 77 kHz -3 dB-rel,  123 kHz / -6 dB-rel.

	MU/CCS switch = CCS-mode:
	lower end: 8.7 Hz -3 dB-rel, 5.5 Hz -6 dB-rel.
	upper end: 50 kHz -3 dB-rel,  87 kHz / -6 dB-rel.
	
- Not running the amplifier to full amplitude output because dummy capacitor is rated to 500 V only

- PSU testing at 220 VAC mains (instead of 230 VAC) to determine headroom of stabilizers vs. max. DC output voltage:

	with no load, raw DC after rectifiers:
	- B+ and B-: raw DC = 447 VDC @ 220 VAC mains (raw DC = 466 VDC @ 230 VAC mains)
	- B2-: raw DC = 
	
	with 27 kOhm dummy load on each B+, B- and B2-:
	- B+ and B-: raw DC = 432 VDC @ 220 VAC mains (raw DC = 452 VDC @ 230 VAC mains)
	- max B+ and B- at 220 VAC mains before stabilisation cuts off = ca. 422 VDC at PSU output (current = U/R = 15.6 mA)
	- max B2- at 220 VAC mains before stabilisation cuts off = 525 VDC at PSU output (current = 19.4 mA)
	
	with real load of two STEREO amps = 60 + 60 mA (B+, B-) and 20 + 20 mA (B2-), the cut off will tend to happen at slightly lower voltages.
	--> estimated target values (will need confirmation later with real amps in place):
	B+ and B- = +/- 420 VDC
	B2- = 520 VDC
	
	--> adjusted HV PSU output to these values --- NEED TO CONFIRM ONCE BOTH AMPLIFIER BOARDS ARE HOOKED UP TO THE HV PSU!!!




*** TO DO ***

- Check LTP tail CCS: current at target value 20 mA? Adjust CCS sense resistor if necessary

- Check buffer CCS loads: current at target value 10 mA? Voltage drop across R42 and R44 (536 Ohm?). Adjust CCS sense resistor if necessary.

- Check HV PSU output: make sure regulation can be adjusted to correct target values works ok with mains variable from 220...240 VAC:
	B+ = 440 VDC
	B- = -440 VDC
	B2- = -550 VDC

	---> 2024-10-20 tests: adjusted to lower values (need to confirm/test/validate once real STEREO amp with full current draw is in place):
	B+ = 420 VDC
	B- = -420 VDC
	B2- = -520 VDC
	

- DONE Repeat 2024-10-19 tests with realisic dummy load (100 pF capacitor through 5.1k "safety" resistors)

- DONE PCB layout: add test point for such that it's easy to attach probes/clips for monitoring and adjusting DC bias. Example: Keystone 5010 test point

- DONE (for now): Powersupply: try the beefy high-voltage BJTs for the overload protection. --> test with controlled load somehow.

- NO, THAT'S NO GOOD (WOULD CAUS TOO MUCH RIPPLE UPSTREAM THE VOLTAGE STABILIZER, CAUSING THE CCS TO CUT OFF!) Powersupply: Save space by using smaller caps after rectifier in B+ and B- PSU (similar to those in B2-)?
  --> will need to look at ripple on rail voltage once amp is up and running.

- DONE If HV PSU works fine with the beefy high-voltage BJT current limiters
	--> repeat amp testing with the proper PSU in place (instead of bench PSUs)
	--> repeat amp testing with VT25 DHTs instead of KT66 (adjust grid bias voltage!!!)

- DONE, BUT ONLY TESTED AT DC SO FAR: FOR TESTING IN ONE BRANCH: Change AOT1N60 to DN2540, which has much lower saturation voltage and will therefore provide stiffer CCS at the 4...5 V drain-source voltage provided by the Vgs value of the IXTP cascode FET. Capacitances and gfs are very similar between the AOT1N60 to DN2540 parts. That might also help with the oscillation issue in the mu-stage, allowing a larger Rmu resistor for higher CCS impedance.

- DONE, BUT MORE TESTING MAY BE USEFUL (ISSUE WAS LIKELY THE EXCESSIVE CURRENT IN THE CCS OF THE BUFFER STAGE): Figure out what causes the failure of the driver/input stage when driving the tubes hard:
	- (so far, the failure only happened when the DHT grids were connected to the buffer stage)
	- overvoltage across CCS FET? DN2540 is good to 400V across Drain-Source, but there might be more during large signal swings. Replace with IXTP3N100D2 (use approx. 330 Ohm sense resistor for 10mA).
	- DIODE CAN'T LIMIT THE HF SPIKES IN CCS, NO CHANGE ON SCOPE! add protection diode in buffer CCS to prevent CCS FET drain from swinging below source voltage, which is linked to B2-
	- Test 1: drive it hard without tubes (high frequency, high amplitude)
	- Test 2: somehow simulate grid load without DHT tubes to better understand what's going on
	- Test 3: use an old dummy tube (instead of the valuable VT25 / 801A DHTs) to test the amp. An KT66 should do, may need somewhat more negative grid bias.
	
- DONE Check how output stage behaves at high-frequency test signals. Ringing? Oscillation? Runaway?

- DONE (WITH KT66 DUMMY): Rmu = 470 Ohm works fine with DN2540.
Determine the max. Rmu in the output mu-stage that does not lead to oscillation (with DN2540)? --> order parts with suitable power spec.

- Check: what happens if the output voltage from the input/driver stage swings close (or even beyond) B2-. What happens in the CCS loads of the buffer stage if this happens? Should there be a protection diode from Drain to Source of the CCS FET to prevent the drain from swinging negative relative to the Source?

- CHECK: are there fusible resistors that would work for the 5.1k current limiter / safety resistors at the headphone outputs?

- PCBs: redo the part labels/numbers for more consistent numbering.

- (DONE??? CHECK...) Change R13 and R18 to lower value (100k) for tighter bias control and fc = 3 Hz
- Change R30+R31+R32 and R35+R36+R37 from single 866k to 3x series parts (to keep them within the power/voltage limits)
- B+ and B- HV PSU: Change RSET value from 866k to 890k or 900k or so. <-- really necessary???
- (Really? Naahhh...) HV PSU: replace NTHL1000N170M1 with STW5NK100Z (TO247)
- DONE / DACT 10k -- choose/decide on volume pot: need 4-deck attenuator with very tight matching to maintain the symmetry of the balanced input --> switched attenuator using fixed low-tolerance resistors is a good idea.
- design chassis, mechanical construction
- for later: design integrated DHT filament supply containing rectifiers, Raw DC filtering  and FILAMENT CCS
