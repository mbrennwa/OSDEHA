Build and test log

2024-04-20
- Built and tested heater supply for input stage tubes + relay for HV delay. Needed to reverse one of the rectifier diodes. Seems to work ok, but still need to test htr supply with proper load.
- Built negative bias + buffer HV supply. Needed to attach part of the GND plane to GND (was not connected on PCB).

2024-04-21
- Tested neg. bias + buffer HV supply. Needed to adjust some of the resistor values in the CCS for voltage reference. Works ok, also under load of up to 120 mA.
- Built B+ and B- supplies. Did not yet test them.

2024-05-03
- Tested delay switch for B+ and B- supply. Works.
- Tested B+ and B- supply (without load). Works. Adjusted to +/-440 VDC out.

2024-05-04
- Tested PSU board using the Toroidy mains transformers (instead of DC input from bench PSU as before). Works.
- Built stator HV bias. Tested by loading it with a 4.7 uF capacitor for a few seconds, then meansured the voltage across the cap using a DVM. Voltage drops due to internal resistance of DVM, but first reading was above 500 VDC, so it seems to work ok. (see also further measurement 2024-05-09)

2024-05-04
- Moved PSU board to prototype chassis with IEC inlet and mains switch for easier and safer work
- Tested ground loop breaker. Works as expected.

2024-05-09
- Installed mains transformers and wiring in proto chassis
- Tested PSU in proto chassis (ok)
- Measured stator BIAS using a very high value resistor (approx 10 G Ohm) in series with the DVM (internal resistance approx. 10 M Ohm). The 10 GOhm resistor effectively reduces the load on the BIAS supply. Calibrated the DVM readings from other PSU outputs. Result: BIAS = 575 VDC (that's less than 1% off from the target!). Perfect.

- Built amplifier input stage. Picked random 6E5P tubes from the box (no matching etc.):
	Operating points around tubes are as expected (measured: 11 mA Ic, 3.1 V-cathode, Va = 152 V and 142 V)
	Measured gain = 30.1 dB = 32x
	Captured harmonic and IM distortion spectra at output voltages of 1.0, 3.16, 10, and 31.6 Vrms. Looks ok.
- Replaced 6E5P tubes with a nicely matched pair to check for improvements in circuit balance and distortion spectra
	Operating points are very symmetric (Va = 153 V and 154 V), distortion spectra are cleaner (sometimes a by a lot)
- Comparison of harmonic distortion with unmatched / matched 6E5P input tubes:
	V-out (Vrms)	matched		2nd (dB)	3rd (dB)
	1.0		no		-92		--
	1.0		yes		--		--
	3.16		no		-85		-91
	3.16		yes		-91		-110
	10		no		-76		-86
	10		yes		-83		-91
	31.6		no		-64		-94
	31.6		yes		-79		-91

	--> 2nd is always considerably lower with matched tubes, 3rd is sometimes lower.

- Built and tested 4 x Coleman DHT Filament Regulators.



*** TO DO ***
- Improve PSU tolerance to shorts and similar mishaps. So far the the output FET tends to blow up every time something nasty happens. Follow the steps described by Jan Didden in his T-Reg article.
- Design PCB for raw DC supply for Coleman Regs. Note on wiring (each channel): common DHT cathodes <--> common Coleman-NEG-pins (both boards linked by solid wire) <--> NEG pin of DC raw supply
- Order new/revised PCBs.
- Link pairs of Coleman DHT Regs using solid wires between boards.
- Build and test amp output stage
- Tweak and finalize amp PCB, order next version and build/test amp. Add HV psu caps to amp board?
- test PSU time-delay adjust range for B+ / B- relay. Maybe increase turn-on delay time a bit to allow for more warm up of the input-stage tubes?
- design chassis, mechanical construction
- choose/decide on volume pot
- for later: design integrated DHT filament supply containing rectifiers, Raw DC filtering  and FILAMENT CCS
