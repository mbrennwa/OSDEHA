Build and test log

2024-04-20
- Built and tested heater supply for input stage tubes + relay for HV delay. Needed to reverse one of the rectifier diodes. Seems to work ok, but still need to test htr supply with proper load.
- Built negative bias + buffer HV supply. Needed to attach part of the GND plane to GND (was not connected on PCB).

2024-04-21
- Tested neg. bias + buffer HV supply. Needed to adjust some of the resistor values in the CCS for voltage reference. Works ok, also under load of up to 120 mA.
- Built B+ and B- supplies. Did not yet test them.

2024-05-03
- Tested delay switch for B+ and B- supply. Works.
- Tested B+ and B- supply (without load). Works. Adjusted to +/-440 VDC out.

2024-05-04
- Tested PSU board using the Toroidy mains transformers (instead of DC input from bench PSU as before). Works.
- Built HV BIAS supply. Tested by loading it with a 4.7 uF capacitor for a few seconds, then meansured the voltage across the cap using a DVM. Voltage drops due to internal resistance of DVM, but first reading was above 500 VDC, so it seems to work ok. (see also further measurement 2024-05-09)

2024-05-04
- Moved PSU board to prototype chassis with IEC inlet and mains switch for easier and safer work
- Tested ground loop breaker. Works as expected.

2024-05-09
- Installed mains transformers and wiring in proto chassis
- Tested PSU in proto chassis (ok)
- Measured diaphgragm BIAS using a very high value resistor (approx 10 G Ohm) in series with the DVM (internal resistance approx. 10 M Ohm). The 10 GOhm resistor effectively reduces the load on the BIAS supply. Calibrated the DVM readings from other PSU outputs. Result: BIAS = 575 VDC (that's less than 1% off from the target!). Perfect.

2024-05-11
- Built amplifier input stage. Picked random 6E5P tubes from the box (no matching etc.):
	Operating points around tubes are as expected (measured: 11 mA Ic, 3.1 V-cathode, Va = 152 V and 142 V)
	Measured gain = 30.1 dB = 32x
	Captured harmonic and IM distortion spectra at output voltages of 1.0, 3.16, 10, and 31.6 Vrms. Looks ok.
- Replaced 6E5P tubes with a nicely matched pair to check for improvements in circuit balance and distortion spectra
	Operating points are very symmetric (Va = 153 V and 154 V), distortion spectra are cleaner (sometimes a by a lot)
- Comparison of harmonic distortion with unmatched / matched 6E5P input tubes:
	V-out (Vrms)	matched		2nd (dB)	3rd (dB)
	1.0		no		-92		--
	1.0		yes		--		--
	3.16		no		-85		-91
	3.16		yes		-91		-110
	10		no		-76		-86
	10		yes		-83		-91
	31.6		no		-64		-94
	31.6		yes		-79		-91

	--> 2nd is always considerably lower with matched tubes, 3rd is sometimes lower.
- Probe slip --> short and bang! Let's stop for today...

2024-05-12
- Built and tested 4 x Coleman DHT Filament Regulators.

2024-05-13
- Work on circuit+PCB design for HV PSU protection (following Jan Didden T-Reg description). Increased trimmer R value for HV time-delay switch to allow longer turn-on delay.
- Work on PCB design for raw-DC supply for Coleman DHT Filament regs.
- Found issue with HV PSU after short (test probe slip): protection Zeners on MOSFets (G-S) shorted out. One MOSFet was drawing a lot of grid current, which messed up the CCS voltage reference. Replaced all HV MOSFets and Zeners.

2024-05-14
- Tested HV PSU: output voltages are ok again, adjusted to target values. Measued voltage drop across the MOSFet gate resistors (300 Ohm): one had 0.0 mV, the other two had 2.7 mV --> gate current is < 1E-5 A, or 50x less than CCS current.
- Check parts on amp board (IPS) after short (probe slip and bang) on 2024-05-11. Replaced the DN2540 parts in the CCS (just in case they were damaged). All resistors checked ok. 6E5P heaters are ok, but the anode/cathode/grid system is shot. Replaced the tubes. Amp IPS now works again. Test signals taken after DC-coupling caps (470nF):
	- Output (balanced) sine signal starts clipping at 106 Vrms. Thats 300 Vpp.
	- Triangle and rect signals are clean, no overshoot.
	- Frequency response is flat up to 720 kHz, where sine signal is down by 1/2x (-6 dB).
	
2024-05-15
- More work on PCB layout for HV PSU (avoid vertical small resistors for easier debugging)
- Fixed errors on amp schematic and PCB (wrong CCS connection, wrong pinout on some FETs). Further improvements on PCB layout.
- Tested fixed-bias voltage adjust/range. Works ok.
- Tested buffer stage. Does not work, seems to short out the HV B2- supply somehow. I can't figure it out, possibly due to the messed up pinout and CCS connection (I tried some workarounds on the PCB, but no success). Tested CCS and buffer circuit in a dead-bug build, and that seemed to work as expected.
- Finalized new version of PCBs (amp, HV PSU, DC-raw filament PSU), exported Gerbers, and ordered new PCBs (JLCPCB).

2024-05-16
- Built wire harness with load resistors for HV PSU for easy and simultaneous testing of the PSU under load: 4-pin KK396 on PSU/PCB end, other end of wires to 3 x 27k power resistors linked to GND.
- Tested PSU again using the load harness: B+ and B- were fine, B2- was at -50 VDC instead of -550 VDC. Removed NPN-BJT (BC550) from current limiter, which fixed the issue (B2 = -549 VDC under load). NPN-BJT was confirmed broken with component tester. Looks like I destroyed the BC550 during some mishap, but did not notice it because the B2- PSU showed the correct voltage (when it was not connected to a load!), so I missed this.
- No-functional buffer stage in the amp (see 2024-05-15) was most likely related to the misbehaving B2- supply.

2024-05-25
- Rebuilt amp (IPS and buffer) using new PCBs. Works as expected. Buffer output starts clipping at 144 Vpp, which is way more than needed to drive the the output stage to full output. No ringing or oscillations visible on scope with triangle or square wave signals. Bandwidth is 670 kHz (-3 dB) or 1 MHz (-6 dB).

2024-05-26
- Determined values of R15 (R20) to get Vbias adjustment centered at target value at output of buffer stage --> R15 = 18.7k is a good value (with R12=47k, R14=20k and R11=1M) --> Vbias = -478V at buffer output if R14/pot is at center position.
- Gate current for Q3 (Q4): voltage across R13 (1M) is <0.2 V, so current is less than 0.2 uA.
- Built and tested raw DC supplies for Coleman Regs. Tested (without load), looks ok.

2024-06-01
- Wired DHT output tubes and Coleman Regs to amplifier board. Tested and adjusted filament supply through amplifier board, works ok.
- Built output stage on amplifier board (Gyrator etc.). Connected HV PSUs (B+, B-, B2-). Does not work. Smoke from AOT Fets (or something nearby, could not see well).

2024-06-02
- Rebuilt gyrator with correct pinout on the FETs. No more smoke, but still does not work. Does the tube/anode load down the protection Zeners and then pulls the gate and the 4.5M resistor low? There is quite a bit of DC across the 4.5M resistor. Also, the B+ supply was broken, so that may also have caused problems with the gyrator.
- Rebuilt PSU using the new PCB. 6.3 V heater supply tested ok. Need to test the remaining parts.
- B2- supply of new PSU-PCB does not work (B+ and B- not yet tested). Testing B2- without Q5 installed. Very low voltage across RSET. Voltage across R18 (1k) is 0.5V, so CCS current is 0.5 mA (about right). Does the overcurrent limiter (Q6) suck up all the current coming out of R18? --> remove Q6 and check again.

2024-06-03
- Pinout of 2N3904 Q6/Q10/Q14 is backwards on amplifier PCB. This would explain why the current is "sucked out" of the CCS, upseting the voltage reference in the HV PSU.
- Fixed pinout on PCB design.

2024-06-07
- Repaired B2- HV PSU and built B+ and B- HV PSU (using correct pinout of 2N3904 BJT). Tested ok.


*** TO DO ***
- B+ and B- HV PSU: Change RSET value from 866k to 890k or 900k or so.
- Test HV PSUs of the new PCB: partially done 2026-06-02, but does not yet work correctly. Wrong pinout on Q6 / 2N3904?
- Build and test amp output stage: done 2024-06-02, but does not (yet?) work due to issue with B+ or drag-down of gate of CCS-FET???
- design chassis, mechanical construction
- choose/decide on volume pot: need 4-deck attenuator with very tight matching to maintain the symmetry of the balanced input --> switched attenuator using fixed low-tolerance resistors is a good idea.
- for later: design integrated DHT filament supply containing rectifiers, Raw DC filtering  and FILAMENT CCS
