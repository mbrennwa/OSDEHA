Build and test log

2024-04-20
- Built and tested heater supply for input stage tubes + relay for HV delay. Needed to reverse one of the rectifier diodes. Seems to work ok, but still need to test htr supply with proper load.
- Built negative bias + buffer HV supply. Needed to attach part of the GND plane to GND (was not connected on PCB).

2024-04-21
- Tested neg. bias + buffer HV supply. Needed to adjust some of the resistor values in the CCS for voltage reference. Works ok, also under load of up to 120 mA.
- Built B+ and B- supplies. Did not yet test them.

2024-05-03
- Tested delay switch for B+ and B- supply. Works.
- Tested B+ and B- supply (without load). Works. Adjusted to +/-440 VDC out.

2024-05-04
- Tested PSU board using the Toroidy mains transformers (instead of DC input from bench PSU as before). Works.
- Built HV BIAS supply. Tested by loading it with a 4.7 uF capacitor for a few seconds, then meansured the voltage across the cap using a DVM. Voltage drops due to internal resistance of DVM, but first reading was above 500 VDC, so it seems to work ok. (see also further measurement 2024-05-09)

2024-05-04
- Moved PSU board to prototype chassis with IEC inlet and mains switch for easier and safer work
- Tested ground loop breaker. Works as expected.

2024-05-09
- Installed mains transformers and wiring in proto chassis
- Tested PSU in proto chassis (ok)
- Measured stator BIAS using a very high value resistor (approx 10 G Ohm) in series with the DVM (internal resistance approx. 10 M Ohm). The 10 GOhm resistor effectively reduces the load on the BIAS supply. Calibrated the DVM readings from other PSU outputs. Result: BIAS = 575 VDC (that's less than 1% off from the target!). Perfect.

- Built amplifier input stage. Picked random 6E5P tubes from the box (no matching etc.):
	Operating points around tubes are as expected (measured: 11 mA Ic, 3.1 V-cathode, Va = 152 V and 142 V)
	Measured gain = 30.1 dB = 32x
	Captured harmonic and IM distortion spectra at output voltages of 1.0, 3.16, 10, and 31.6 Vrms. Looks ok.
- Replaced 6E5P tubes with a nicely matched pair to check for improvements in circuit balance and distortion spectra
	Operating points are very symmetric (Va = 153 V and 154 V), distortion spectra are cleaner (sometimes a by a lot)
- Comparison of harmonic distortion with unmatched / matched 6E5P input tubes:
	V-out (Vrms)	matched		2nd (dB)	3rd (dB)
	1.0		no		-92		--
	1.0		yes		--		--
	3.16		no		-85		-91
	3.16		yes		-91		-110
	10		no		-76		-86
	10		yes		-83		-91
	31.6		no		-64		-94
	31.6		yes		-79		-91

	--> 2nd is always considerably lower with matched tubes, 3rd is sometimes lower.
- Probe slip --> short and bang! Let's stop for today...

2024-05-12
- Built and tested 4 x Coleman DHT Filament Regulators.

2024-05-13
- Work on circuit+PCB design for HVÂ PSU protection (following Jan Didden T-Reg description). Increased trimmer R value for HV time-delay switch to allow longer turn-on delay.
- Work on PCB design for raw-DC supply for Coleman DHT Filament regs.
- Found issue with HV PSU after short (test probe slip): protection Zeners on MOSFets (G-S) shorted out. One MOSFet was drawing a lot of grid current, which messed up the CCS voltage reference. Replaced all HV MOSFets and Zeners.

2024-05-14
- Tested HV PSU: output voltages are ok again, adjusted to target values. Measued voltage drop across the MOSFet gate resistors (300 Ohm): one had 0.0 mV, the other two had 2.7 mV --> gate current is < 1E-5 A, or 50x less than CCS current.
- Check parts on amp board (IPS) after short (probe slip and bang) on 2024-05-11. Replaced the DN2540 parts in the CCS (just in case they were damaged). All resistors checked ok. 6E5P heaters are ok, but the anode/cathode/grid system is shot. Replaced the tubes. Amp IPS now works again. Test signals taken after DC-coupling caps (470nF):
	- Output (balanced) sine signal starts clipping at 106 Vrms. Thats 300 Vpp.
	- Triangle and rect signals are clean, no overshoot.
	- Frequency response is flat up to 720 kHz, where sine signal is down by 1/2x (-6 dB).
	
2024-05-15
- More work on PCB layout for HV PSU (avoid vertical small resistors for easier debugging)
- Fixed errors on amp schematic and PCB (wrong CCS connection, wrong pinout on some FETs). Further improvements on PCB layout.
- Tested fixed-bias voltage adjust/range. Works ok.
- Tested buffer stage. Does not work, seems to short out the HV B2- supply somehow. I can't figure it out, possibly due to the messed up pinout and CCS connection (I tried some workarounds on the PCB, but no success). Tested CCS and buffer circuit in a dead-bug build, and that seemed to work as expected.
- Finalized new version of PCBs (amp, HV PSU, DC-raw filament PSU), exported Gerbers, and ordered new PCBs (JLCPCB).

*** TO DO ***
- Link pairs of Coleman DHT Regs using solid wires between boards.
- Build and test amp output stage
- design chassis, mechanical construction
- choose/decide on volume pot
- for later: design integrated DHT filament supply containing rectifiers, Raw DC filtering  and FILAMENT CCS
