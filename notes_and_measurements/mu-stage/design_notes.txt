Design of the output stage mu-stage / active load

General idea and concept following Allan Kimmel "MU-STAGE PHILOSOPHY" paper: hybrid mu-stage with AC-coupled CCS made from a (cascoded) FET as very-high impedance load for the output tube(s).

The OSDEHA mu-stage works at B+ = 440 V, B- = -440 V, and an idle current of 20 mA.

For operation at high voltage, the CCS FET ("lower" FET) is cascoded with N-channel depletion mode FET ("upper FET") that (i) carries the high voltage burden and (ii) provides additional rejection of ripple and noise in the B+ supply. The CCS lower FET then operates with a Drain-Source voltage equal to the Gate-Source voltage of the cascode FET. The cascode FET is an IXTP3N100D2, which has measured Vgs = 2.8...3.4V for 440V/20mA (measured values from two parts from different production batches). This Vgs voltage will show some variation with the audio signal as the voltage across the "upper" FET changes with the audio signal. The "lower" FET should be insensitive to this "upper" Vgs change to get stable CCS operation of the mu-stage.

What is a good choice for the "lower" FET?
- Operating point: Drain-Source approx. 2.8...3.4 V, Drain current 20 mA
- Insensitive to Vgs change of the "upper" FET as described above
- Needs to work well with Drain-Source voltage below 2.8 V (as determined by the "top" IXTP FET)
- High transconductance (gfs) for low high CCS impedance
- Low capacitances high-frequency operation (mainly Crss, Ciss and Coss to a lesser degree, see https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/powerdrive-how-to-choose-the-right-mosfet-part.352821/post-6165732 )
- Through-hole part (TO220 or smaller)
- not critical, but nice to have: low voltage Drain-Source voltage drop to keep the Source voltage close to GND (Gate pin is at GND for DC operation)

Candidates:
- AOT1N60: gfs = 0.12 A/V (at 3 V /20 mA), Crss = 2..5 pF (datasheet Fig. 8), curves are not straight at Vds < 7, and are sloped upwards throughout
- DN2540: gfs = 0.13 A/V (at 3 V /20 mA), Crss = 1 pF (datasheet "typical" value), VERY flat curves at Vds > 2 V and Id < 40 mA.

--> DN2540 is much less sensitive to Vgs variation of the upper FET, has slightly lower Crss, and has the same gfs than AOT1N60. DN2540 is also a depletion mode device, so it's DC Source voltage will be slightly positive relative to the Gate, which is at GND, so the audio output will be closer to 0 V (GND) than with the AOT1N60.
