Time-current relationship of physiological effects and electrical safety

IEC 60479-1 specifies the four zones of current-time relationships and describes the pathological physiological effects on the human body within each zone, as shown in Figure 1. The horizontal axis represents the current through the human body, and the vertical axis represents the duration of the current. The meaning of each zone is as follows: AC-1 zone indicates no perception; AC-2 zone indicates perception; AC-3 zone indicates reversible muscular contractions; AC-4 zone indicates possible irreversible effects; AC-4-1 zone indicates up to 5% probability of ventricular fibrillation; AC-4-2 zone indicates up to 50% probability of ventricular fibrillation; AC-4-3 zone indicates more than 50% probability of ventricular fibrillation. The curves in the figure represent: curve A, the perception threshold; curve B, the muscle reaction threshold; curve C1, the threshold for 0% probability of ventricular fibrillation; curve C2, the threshold for 5% probability of ventricular fibrillation; curve C3, the threshold for 50% probability of ventricular fibrillation. For example, if the current through the human body exceeds 30 mA, the person is likely to be electrocuted unless the current can be cut off within a very short time.
