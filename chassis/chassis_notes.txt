Internal chassis dimensions:
- length ca 30 cm (1 x amp board + 2 x Coleman regs on each side / on each heatsink)
- width determined by board dimensions (2 x width amp boards + 1 x length main PSU)
- height determined by main PSU height (big caps) + subchassis for DHT output tubes + volume pot

Heatsinks:
- dimensions: 300 mm x 100..150 mm
- Fischer SK 56 100..150 SA has strong/flat fins on end, easy to fit front plate/screws



Ideas and thoughts
	- DON'T (EITHER UGLY OR DOES NOT FIT, WILL NEED MACHINING FOR HOLES/PLUGS/VOLUME-KNOB -- FRONTPANEL DESIGN IS EASIER!) Use ready made chassis (19zoll.com, modushop, etc.) or go with separate heatsinks + Schaeffer panels?
	- amp boards on the sides, flat on bottom plate, transistors on heatsinks
	- transformers on the back, on bottom plate (or on rear plate?), between the amp boards
	- PSU boards on the bottom plate, just behind the fron plate.
	- RAW DC supply for Coleman regs on rear panel?
	- 4 x power DHTs mounted on sub-chassis above PSU board / transformers
	- Coleman regs near the DHTs on the subchassis for accessibility to adjust filament voltages?
	  ALTERNATIVE: Coleman regs on bottom plate, between amp boards (either near rear or front panel) / 2 Colemans ons left and 2 Colemans on right
	- IEC mains inlet on the rear plate, left side
	- Audio XLR inputs on the rear plate, right side
	- Volume pot (4 channel for balanced/stereo): centered or on the right (away from mains inlet)? Mount pot on subchassis used for DHT output tubes? Use extension rod to the button on the front panel 
	- Headphone jack(s) on front panel, location depending on position of volume control
	- Power indicator LED on front panel, driven by heater supply
	- Front plate covers heat sinks on the sides, plate fixed by four screws into the front edges of the heatsinks (cut threads into heatsinks)
	- Heatsinks fixed to bottom plate with screws, theads cut into lower edge of heatsinks
	- Top and rear plates mounted in between the heatsinks using square alu rods as connectors (about 10x10mm)
	  (top plate connects to the heatsinks, with threaded holes in heatsinks)
	  (reat plate connects to bottom and top plates, so less work messing around with cutting threads in heasinks)
