Concept:
- 2 chassis (1 x amplifier, 1 x power supply):
	- allows acceptable form factor for amplifier module, while PSU can be hidden away (but PSU can also be stacked underneath the amp).
	- Keep recitifier noise away from amplifier
	- use same footprint (and height?) for both chassis, so they can nicely be stacked or placed next to each other
- Amp dimensions (external, without front plate):
	- width = 280 mm (including 2 x 40 mm width of heatsinks on the sides)
	- height = 100 mm [height not including the power tubes sticking out from the top]
	- depth = 300 mm
- PSU dimensions (external, without front plate):
	- width = 280 mm
	- height = 100 mm [height of large PSU caps 82 mm from PCB]
	- depth = 300 mm
- Connections between PSU and amp:
	- 1 x cable for HV PSU + bias (keep separate from potentially noisy heater / filament RAW DC currents)
	- 1 x cable heater and RAW-DC filament currents (1 x 6.3 VDC for input heaters, 2 x RAW-DC supplies for Coleman Filament regs in the amp chassis)
	- only PSU: IEC mains inlet + switch + fuses
	- only amp: 2 x XLR audio inputs, Stax outputs on frontpanel


Heatsinks for amp:
	- dimensions: 40 x 300 mm x 100 mm
	- Fischer SK 56 100 SA or SK 501 100 SA


PSU inernal arrangement
	- Left: 2 x mains transformers
	- Center: 1 x main PSU board (HV + 6.3 V heater + HV bias)
	- Right: 2 x filament RAW-DC supplies


PSU front panel:
	- Power LED indicator at center
	

PSU rear panel:
	- IEC mains inlet (incl. switch + fuses), on the side where the mains transformers are
	- 2 x cable connectors to amp chassis


Amp internal arrangment:
	- Heasinks on left and right
	- 2 x amp board on heatsinks.
	  Right board aligned to front plate
	  Left board aligned to rear plate (to keep input tubes away from front plate, make space for Stax connector on front plate)
	- Coleman boards:
	  2 x boards on right, aligned to rear plate
	- 2 x boards boards on left, aligned to front plate (Stax connector on front plate can mount above the Coleman boards)
	- 4 x power tubes between the amp boards, centered on a line in the middle of the chassis. Tubes sticking out on top of the chassis, mounted on small subchassis
	

Amp front panel:
	- Volume control on right (above right amp board)
	- Stax connector on left (above Coleman regs)
	- Power LED indicator at center


Amp rear panel:
	- 2 x cable connectors to amp chassis
	- 2 x XLR audio inputs
	

Cable connections between PSU and amp chassis:

	Cable I (high voltage lines):
	- B+
	- B-
	- B2-
	- 580 VDC bias
	- GND
	- Earth/chassis

	Cable II (heater/filament RAW-DC):
	- Heater POS (6.3 V)
	- Heater NEG (0 V) [connected to GND on PSU main board]
	- RAW-DC 1 POS [floating]
	- RAW-DC 1 NEG [floating]
	- RAW-DC 2 POS [floating]
	- RAW-DC 2 NEG [floating]
	cable clamp: 206966-7
	
	
	Connector requirements:
	- Use different connectors for the two cables to avoid accidental mixups!
	- PE/chassis connection:
		- PE conncetions on HV cable, not on Filament cable
		- PE/chassis pin on the HV cable must connect before the other pins
	- All connectors must be rated for 600 VDC or more (filament supplies are floating on B- voltage!)
	
	--> Connector HV-Cable: Amphenol DMS 18-8
	    700 V or higher rating
	    center pin is larger/longer, use this for PE -- use extra pins for parallel connections: 2 x PE and 2 x GND between pos and neg HV pins

Old notes, but may be worth to keep:

Ideas and thoughts
	- DON'T (EITHER UGLY OR DOES NOT FIT, WILL NEED MACHINING FOR HOLES/PLUGS/VOLUME-KNOB -- FRONTPANEL DESIGN IS EASIER!) Use ready made chassis (19zoll.com, modushop, etc.) or go with separate heatsinks + Schaeffer panels?
	- amp boards on the sides, flat on bottom plate, transistors on heatsinks
	- transformers on the back, on bottom plate (or on rear plate?), between the amp boards
	- PSU boards on the bottom plate, just behind the front plate.
	- RAW DC supply for Coleman regs on rear panel?
	- 4 x power DHTs mounted on sub-chassis above PSU board / transformers
	- Coleman regs near the DHTs on the subchassis for accessibility to adjust filament voltages?
	  ALTERNATIVE: Coleman regs on bottom plate, between amp boards (either near rear or front panel) / 2 Colemans ons left and 2 Colemans on right
	- IEC mains inlet on the rear plate, left side
	- Audio XLR inputs on the rear plate, right side
	- Volume pot (4 channel for balanced/stereo): centered or on the right (away from mains inlet)? Mount pot on subchassis used for DHT output tubes? Use extension rod to the button on the front panel 
	- Headphone jack(s) on front panel, location depending on position of volume control
	- Power indicator LED on front panel, driven by heater supply
	- Front plate covers heat sinks on the sides, plate fixed by four screws into the front edges of the heatsinks (cut threads into heatsinks)
	- Heatsinks fixed to bottom plate with screws, theads cut into lower edge of heatsinks
	- Top and rear plates mounted in between the heatsinks using square alu rods as connectors (about 10x10mm)
	  (top plate connects to the heatsinks, with threaded holes in heatsinks)
	  (reat plate connects to bottom and top plates, so less work messing around with cutting threads in heasinks)
